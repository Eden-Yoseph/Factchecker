## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Paste any news paragraph for instant analysis  
🧠 Multi-model AI ensemble powered by Hugging Face APIs:
- Detects misleading or toxic language  
- Classifies sentiment and emotional bias  

📊 Hybrid scoring algorithm combining:
- AI inference results  
- Rule-based pattern matching  
- Heuristic credibility metrics  

🔎 Plain-English explanation of red flags or trust signals  
🌐 Responsive web interface (HTML + JS) + Flask backend (Python)  
🔒 Secure token handling and API validation  
🧪 `/check`, `/bulk`, and `/health` endpoints for testing and API integration

## 🧠 AI & NLP Stack

TruthLens uses a weighted ensemble of pre-trained transformer models, plus handcrafted rules, to mimic how humans assess news credibility:

| Purpose                   | Model                                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Toxicity / Misinformation | `martin-ha/toxic-comment-model`                    |
| Sentiment Classification  | `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest` |
| Fallback Dialog (Optional)| `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`                         |

Each model is accessed via Hugging Face’s hosted inference API, with error-handling, retry logic, exponential backoff, and dynamic confidence scoring.

## ⚙️ Intelligent Architecture

| Component           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Layer**     | Dynamically queries Hugging Face transformers with configurable retry/timeout |
| **Rule-Based Analyzer** | Detects suspicious formatting, clickbait phrases, emotional triggers, etc. |
| **Credibility Engine** | Scores text from 0–100 based on both AI output and statistical indicators |
| **Explainability Module** | Converts flags into readable explanations                            |
| **Frontend**        | Beautiful UI with loading states, confidence bar, and real/fake tags        |
